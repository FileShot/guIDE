## What is guIDE?

**guIDE** is a full-featured, AI-native code editor built from the ground up — not a fork, not a wrapper, not an extension. It runs AI models **directly on your hardware** using local LLM inference, so you never hit rate limits, never need a subscription, and never send your code to someone else's server.

Frustrated by rate limits on Cursor? Tired of monthly subscriptions for Windsurf? guIDE is the answer.

## Why guIDE?

| $20/month subscriptions that add up | **$9.99 one-time payment** — own it forever |
| Code sent to cloud servers | **100% local processing** — your code never leaves your machine |
| Limited to one AI provider | **8+ cloud providers** + local models — use whatever works |
| Extensions that break or conflict | **Built-in AI from day one** — no extensions needed for AI features |
