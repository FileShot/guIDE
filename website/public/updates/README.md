# Auto-Update Artifacts

This directory is served by graysoft.dev at `https://graysoft.dev/updates/`.

electron-updater fetches `latest.yml` from this URL to check for new releases.

## Deploying a New Release

After running `npm run build` (or the unsigned build with `electron-builder --config electron-builder.nosign.json`):

1. Copy `dist-electron/latest.yml` → `website/public/updates/latest.yml`
2. Copy `dist-electron/guIDE-Setup-X.Y.Z.exe` → `website/public/updates/guIDE-Setup-X.Y.Z.exe`
3. Deploy the website (or copy files to the server's static directory for graysoft.dev)

The `latest.yml` contains the SHA512 hash and file size — electron-updater verifies this 
before launching the installer, so users can't be given a tampered binary.

## Files in this directory (git-ignored)

- `latest.yml` — version manifest (auto-generated by electron-builder)
- `guIDE-Setup-*.exe` — Windows NSIS installer (~400MB, NOT committed to git)

Use `.gitignore` in this directory to keep installers out of the repository.
